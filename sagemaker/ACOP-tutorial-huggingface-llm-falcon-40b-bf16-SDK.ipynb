    "Falcon is a causal decoder-only model built by [Technology Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae/) (TII) and trained on more than 1 trillion tokens of RefinedWeb enhanced with curated corpora. It was built using custom-built tooling for data pre-processing and model training built on Amazon SageMaker. As of June 6, 2023, it is the best open-source model currently available. Falcon-40B outperforms LLaMA, StableLM, RedPajama, MPT, etc. To see comparison, see [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard). It features an architecture optimized for inference, with FlashAttention and multiquery. \n",

It is observed that models trained on RefinedWeb achieve performance equal to or better than performance achieved by training model on curated datasets, while only relying on web data.\n",

To use this model, please select `model_id` in the cell above to be \"huggingface-llm-falcon-7b-bf16\".\n",

It has surpassed renowned models like LLaMA-65B, StableLM, RedPajama and MPT on the public leaderboard maintained by Hugging Face, demonstrating its exceptional performance without specialized fine-tuning.

    "* **max_length:** Model generates text until the output length (which includes the input context length) reaches `max_length`. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **max_new_tokens:** Model generates text until the output length (excluding the input context length) reaches `max_new_tokens`. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **num_beams:** Number of beams used in the greedy search. If specified, it must be integer greater than or equal to `num_return_sequences`.\n",
    "* **no_repeat_ngram_size:** Model ensures that a sequence of words of `no_repeat_ngram_size` is not repeated in the output sequence. If specified, it must be a positive integer greater than 1.\n",
    "* **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",
    "* **early_stopping:** If True, text generation is finished when all beam hypotheses reach the end of sentence token. If specified, it must be boolean.\n",
    "* **do_sample:** If True, sample the next word as per the likelihood. If specified, it must be boolean.\n",
    "* **top_k:** In each step of text generation, sample from only the `top_k` most likely words. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **top_p:** In each step of text generation, sample from the smallest possible set of words with cumulative probability `top_p`. If specified, it must be a float between 0 and 1.\n",
    "* **return_full_text:** If True, input text will be part of the output generated text. If specified, it must be boolean. The default value for it is False.\n",
    "* **stop**: If specified, it must a list of strings. Text generation stops if any one of the specified strings is generated.\n",

    "Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances. EBS volumes that are attached to an instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance. You can create a file system on top of these volumes, or use them in any way you would use a block device (such as a hard drive). You can dynamically change the configuration of a volume attached to an instance.\n",
    "We recommend Amazon EBS for data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence. EBS volumes are particularly well-suited for use as the primary storage for file systems, databases, or for any applications that require fine granular updates and access to raw, unformatted, block-level storage. Amazon EBS is well suited to both database-style applications that rely on random reads and writes, and to throughput-intensive applications that perform long, continuous reads and writes.\n",
